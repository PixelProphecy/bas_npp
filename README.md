# bas_npp
## What it is
A simple XML file to import as User Defined Language in Notepad++ which allows syntax highlighting of files written in BASIC.

## Issues
There are still some minor issues I wasn't able to work out, such as labels and sometimes numbers after a statement donâ€™t get the default number color.

Also, all statemens, keywords, and functions need to be UPPER CASE to work. I chose to limit it to uppercase because otherwise text contained in strings looked overly garish and 


## Installation

1. Download the ink_npp.xml file
2. Open Notepad++
3. In the menu bar, click "Languages" and to the bottom, "Define your language..."
4. Click "Import"
5. Select and open the `bas_npp.xml` file you downloaded before
6. Close the Language Definition Window.

Each time you want to highlight Ink markup, just select it from the Language menu. It will be at the bottom with the other user defined styles.
If you open files with an .bas extension, they should get recognized as such automatically.

### Alternate Method
(from the [Notepad++ website](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm)

1. Download the user-defined language to your computer
2. Open the file with your favourite text editor (such as notepad++ or notepad)
3. Click start, run, type (or paste in) %APPDATA%\Notepad++ then click ok
4. Open userDefineLang.xml with a text editor
5. If this is the first userdefined language you are adding, copy/paste the entire first file (which you downloaded) into the userDefineLang.xml, replacing all that was there. If this is the second or more language you add, simply copy everything from the first file starting at `<UserLang...>` to `</UserLang>` and paste it at the end of the userDefineLang.xml right before `</NotepadPlus>`
6. Save the newly improved userDefineLang.xml
